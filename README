This is the Moodle 2.6+ version

All future weeks are hidden from the student view, based on enrolled date.
If course start date is greater than the current enrolled date all future weeks will be hidden from the student.
As a teacher you can see future weeks and should leave them unhidden so that they do become visible when that week arrives.
